# Style guides (a.k.a. pattern libraries, templates)

Notes for style guide discussion for SRCCON 2014.

## What is a style guide?

This is my own definition.

A style guide creates standards and best practices for a system or set of decisions that are otherwise subjective.

To note, "style" does not mean that the decisions are visual, it means that the decision that is made is subjective and based on opinion or style.

There are two main questions to think about when defining what a style guide is.  The style of what system or set of decisions?  And, how are standards and best practices transferred or communicated?

[Wikipedia article about style guides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide)

### The style of what?

There are many different possibilities of what it is that is being styled.

* digital interfaces (web)
* print design/layout
* code
* copy
* tone
* visualizations
* interactives
* project management

### Medium of the guide

How these best practices and standards are communicated can vary as well.

* narrative
* code
* specifications
* generative

## Pros and cons

### Pros

* Saves time building.

* Provides consistency.
* Easier to maintain whatever the style guide is for.
* Can provide for an early testbed.

## Cons

* May limit creativity.

## Examples

This is not an exhaustive list.
